## About
Hello! I'm a passionate Electrical and Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm looking for internships in the field of software development where I can put my strong knowledge of programming principles, data structures, algorithms, and software architecture to use.

My problem-solving drive and strong communication abilities, paired with my technical expertise and knack for invention, uniquely equip me to make a significant impact. I had hands-on experience working on a variety of projects at UT Austin, including implementing IoT solutions, programming microcontrollers, and developing machine learning models. I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to software development projects because I am fluent in C++, Python, and Java.
